#+TITLE: ImageTools F# Cmdlet library

Tricky beast this.

Personally I'm using it together with a powershell script to move
files to a central location then copy images with lower quality from
there to personal locations.

To build the project, try the following:

: dotnet publish --framework net5.0 --runtime win-x64 --self-contained true
